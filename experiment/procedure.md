1. This experiment introduces the concept of the hierarchical transformations. Here we show the effect of a series of transformations applied on a triangle.

2. We start with a scaling transformation applied to the triangle followed by a translation, rotation and another translation. All these transformations are animated. Drag the slider to animate the transformations on the triangle in order.

3. The tree has a node 'Transformation 1' for the transformations applied to the point. Select it and click edit to open the transformation edit panel which shows the list of transformations applied in order. Select any transformation and move it up or down with the respective buttons in the bottom and notice how the order of transformations effect the final result.

4. Try adding a new transformation to the list and notice the changes on the triangle.
